ASCII = character encoding standard that assigns a unique numerical value which is an iteger.

  end #(letters.min..letters.max).to_a - creates an array of consecutive ASCII codes from the minimum to the maximum ASCII code found in the letters array
  #letters == (letters.min..letters.max).to_a - This checks if the letters array is equal to the array of consecutive ASCII codes, makes sure ASCII codes are contgous if they do = true
  #letters.length-retrieves the number of elements (ASCII codes) in the letters array tells us how many ASCII codes there are. #ship.length -retrieves the length of the ship.
  #letters.length == ship.length - checks if the number of elements in the letters array is equal to the length of the ship,  verifies if the number of coordinates in the letters array matches the expected length of the ship
  #first condition letters == (letters.min..letters.max).to_a checks that the ASCII codes form a contiguous range, making sure that the placement is vertical and consecutive . #second condition = letters.length == ship.length) checks that the number of coordinates matches the ship's length.
