1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

- We know that we did not have to test user input, so we skipped those parts. We wrote tests to make sure all of our instantiations were instances of the appropriate classes. Then we ran through our methods and identified what needed to be tested, based on the methods. Then we wrote the tests.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
- Adding turn #1 on top (cosmetic addition), refactoring our codes to make it shorter (example would be the whole possible configs of the boats that the computer can place on the board), and we want to be able to tell the player what ship was sunk when it sinks.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
- Ping Pong Method, Driver Navigator, Pair Programming.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
- We talked to each other in calls and left comments in PRs.
